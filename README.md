# GetCleanDataProj

## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The objectives of the project are to

* produce a clean data set from the observations downloaded
* upload the R script(s) used to create the clean data set
* create a code book which describes the data, variables used and all transformations done on the data
* complete this readme file for giving an overview

The clean data set is called **meanDF.txt** and is available in this GitHub repo. A duplicate **meanDF.csv** file has also been uploaded to help peruse the clean data set easily.

The R script used is called **run_analysis.R** and is available in this GitHub repo. All transformations are done in the same script. Note that the data set needs to be downloaded outside the script and unzipped into the R working directory for the script to work. This is also recorded in the codebook.

The code book is called **CodeBook.md** and is available in this GitHub repo.
